The aim of this project is to predict whether a female patient, given certain diagnostic
measurements, has diabetes or not, through a series of classification models.  In order to do that, a dataset originally
from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease has been used (available
at:https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset presents several
medical predictor variables and one target variable, called Outcome. Predictor variables include the
number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age and so on. It is important to
underline that these data refer only to females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The original code has been written in R.
